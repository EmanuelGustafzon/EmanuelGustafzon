### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Emanuel

### I love the feeling of opening a blank page in the IDE and building a feature from idea to reality. I enjoy the process of working on solutions I haven't encountered before, where I don't possess all the necessary knowledge. Researching, brainstorming, and delving deeper to solve problems is where I find my stride.

Every day, I strive to learn and develop my skills further, and I'm capable of crafting solutions from concept to deployment. I particularly enjoy writing logic and can seamlessly transition between frontend and backend development.

My favorite languages are TypeScript and C#, The syntax and ecosystems are very enjoyble in my opinion. I have explored different programming languages and I enjoy learning new ones because it broadens my perspective. 

I studied at Code Institute in 2022 and have been coding continuously ever since. This austumn I will study at EC Utbildningen to become a .net developer.

Please feel free to send me an email if you are intrested in networking or looking for interns or part time workers.
