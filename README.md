### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Emanuel

## I love the feeling of opening a blanc page in visual studio and build a feature from idea to reality. 
## I love the process of working on a solution I have not encountered before and not have all the knowledge for.
## I enjoy the process of researching, brainstorming and diving deeper to be able to solve that problem.
