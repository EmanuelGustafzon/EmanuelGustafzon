### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Emanuel

### I love the feeling of opening a blank page in Visual Studio and building a feature from idea to reality. I enjoy the process of working on solutions I haven't encountered before, where I don't possess all the necessary knowledge. Researching, brainstorming, and delving deeper to solve problems is where I find my stride.

Every day, I strive to learn and develop my skills further, and I'm capable of crafting solutions from concept to deployment. I particularly enjoy writing logic and can seamlessly transition between frontend and backend development.

My primary focus has been TypeScript, a language I feel comfortable with. Recently, I've discovered a newfound passion for C# with Entity Framework and Azure as my cloud provider. I have also used python during my studies.

I studied at Code Institute in 2022 and have been coding continuously ever since.

I'm currently seeking job opportunities as a developer, so please feel free to contact me at emanuel.gustafzon@gmail.com.
