### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Emanuel

### I love the feeling of opening a blanc page in visual studio and build a feature from idea to reality. I love the process of working on a solution I have not encountered before and do not have all the knowledge for. I enjoy the process of researching, brainstorming and diving deeper to be able to solve that problem. 

I learn and develop my skills everyday and I am capable of building solutions from idea to deployment. I enjoy writing logic and can work fullstack both frontend and backend.

My main focus has been TypeScript so I feel comfortable with the language. I recently discovered that I also enjoy C# with entity framework and Azure as cloud provider. 

I studied at Code Institue during 2022 and have just kept on coding since. 

currently looking for a job as a devloper so feel free to contact me at: emanuel.gustafzon@gmail.com
